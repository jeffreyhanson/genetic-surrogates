![Summary of single species prioritisations. Single species
prioritisations were generated using amount-based targets, amount-based
and surrogate-based targets, and amount-based and genetic-based targets
for each species. Data shows the performance of prioritisations
generated using these three sets of targets. Bars denote means and
standard
errors.](figures_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

![Multi-species prioritisations. Panel (a) shows the prioritisation
generated for using just amount-based targets. Panel (b) shows the
prioritisation generated using amount-based and surrogate based targets.
Panel (c) shows the prioritisation generated using amount-based and
genetic-based
targets](figures_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

![Summary of multi-species prioritisations. Three prioritisations were
generated using amount-based targets, amount-based and surrogate-based
targets, and amount-based and genetic-based targets for each species.
Data shows the performance of these prioritisations based on how much
genetic variation they explain. Bars denote means and standard
errors.](figures_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

![The relationship between surrogates and genetic variation secured in
prioritizations.](figures_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)
